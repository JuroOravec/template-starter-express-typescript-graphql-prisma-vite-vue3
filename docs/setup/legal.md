# Legal

All legal documents (Privacy policy, Terms of Use, Cookie policy, and Disclaimer)
were generated using [Termly](https://termly.io/products/).

To avoid lock-in, I re-wrote the documents as Vue components.

This way, we have a solid basis, and we have full flexibility in updating the terms.

> NOTE: In the future, it might be better to re-write the documents into markdown
> instead of Vue. Rather, add some markdown-to-vue lib than re-writing it to Vue.
>
> Last time, re-writing the privacy policy took around 4 hrs. And if we used markdown
> we could just copy the text, and then adjust CSS for lists, paragraphs, links, etc.
