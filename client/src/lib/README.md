# Lib dir

This module houses UNOPINIONATED code with underlying or supportive features that can be used
anywhere else in the app.

Unlike the `globals` dir, the code here should be agnostic of our business or setup logic,
and should be treated as an external package.

There should be NO domain / business logic here.
