# Base UI module

- Generic (business-logic agnostic) components:
  - Handling user input (forms and input fields)
  - Design system components

NOTES:

- To avoid name conflicts in case of very generic components (like `Link` or `List`),
  we prefix them with `C` (as Custom), e.g `CLink` or `CList`.
